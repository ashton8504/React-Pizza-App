# React Pizza App

## Description
The React Pizza App is a project that demonstrates the use of React components to build a pizza menu. It covers various concepts and techniques in React development, including component-based architecture, JSX syntax, props, conditional rendering, and separation of concerns.

## Lessons Learned and Topics Covered

- Components: Understanding the concept of components as self-contained pieces of UI with their own data, logic, and appearance.

- JSX: Utilizing JSX syntax to write React components, which allows the inclusion of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic within the components.

- Component Tree: Grasping the parent-child relationships in a component tree and how components can be nested to build complex UI structures.

- Props: Learning about props and their role in passing data from parent components to child components, enabling data flow in a unidirectional manner.

- List Rendering: Utilizing the JavaScript `map()` method to dynamically create lists by iterating over an array of data.

- Conditional Rendering: Implementing conditional rendering techniques using JavaScript tools and operators to show or hide content based on certain conditions.

- Declarative vs. Imperative: Understanding the difference between declarative and imperative programming paradigms, and leveraging React's declarative nature to build UIs efficiently.

- Immutability of Props: Exploring the reasons for not mutating props directly and understanding the importance of maintaining unidirectional data flow.

- Separation of Concerns: Emphasizing the separation of concerns principle by keeping components focused on specific tasks, ensuring modularity and reusability.
